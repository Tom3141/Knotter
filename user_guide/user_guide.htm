<h1><img src="img/logo_big.svg" class="logo" /> Knotter User Guide</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Interlace patterns are a kind of design hystorically used as a decorations in 
many places and by different cultures.</p>

<p>Knotter uses <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knots_and_graphs'>graphs to represent knots</a>.</p>

<p>A good description of the algorithm used to render them and design tips can be 
found at <a href="http://www.entrelacs.net/">Celtic Knotwork: the Ultimate Tutorial</a></p>

<h2>Editing</h2>

<p>A knot is produced from a graph where the edges define interactions between 
two knot lines.</p>

<h3>Adding nodes</h3>

<p>Double clicking on an empty spot on the drawing area will add a node.
If you double click on an edge, the new node will split that edge in two.</p>

<h3>Adding edges</h3>

<p>To toggle edges between nodes, the <em>Link selected</em> and <em>Unlink selected</em>
commands.</p>

<h3>Changing edge type</h3>

<p>Knotter supports three types of edge:</p>

<ul>
<li>Default  - The two lines cross at the edge midpoint, one on top of the other</li>
<li>Inverted - Like default but with the other line on top</li>
<li>Hole     - The line turn back without crossing</li>
<li>Wall     - The lines follow the edge without crossing</li>
</ul>

<div class="figure">
    <img src="img/edge_types.png" alt="Screenshot showing the edge types"  />
    <p class="caption">From left to right: Default, Inverted, Hole, Wall</p>
</div>

<p>The type of an edge is changed with the mouse wheel.</p>

<h3>Quick graph design</h3>

<p>Adding nodes and edges one at the time can be very tedious, knotter provides
the <em>Edge list</em> tool to make the process easier.</p>

<p>When this is enabled, a single click will create a node and each new node is 
connected to the previous one by an edge.</p>

<p>To break the edge chain, click with the right button, you'll be able to start
a new chain from the next node.</p>

<h3>Selection and transformation</h3>

<p>Only nodes can be selected and moved, the edges will follow their vertices.</p>

<p>A single node is selected by left clicking it, multiple nodes can be selected
by holding Shift or Control.</p>

<p>Dragging the mouse from an empty spot will select the nodes within a 
rectangual area.</p>

<p>Dragging one of the selected nodes will move the selection, while moving 
nodes can be transformed using the mouse wheel (will scale the selection)
or Shift + mouse wheel (will rotate the selection around the node under the 
cursor). These transformations are available when pasting nodes.</p>

<p>Selected nodes can be mirrored using the horizontal and vertical flip commands.</p>

<h3>Snapping </h3>

<p>To allow precise designs knotter offers a grid that, when enabled, will snap
nodes to the closest point.</p>

<p>There are three types of grid:
* Square      - A regular square grid.
* Triangular1 - A grid where the elements are equilateral triangles with a horizontal base.
* Triangular2 - A grid where the elements are equilateral triangles with a vertical side.</p>

<h2>Style</h2>


<p>The <em>Knot Style</em> dialog allows the configuration of display and shape options.
Changes are visible in the preview area of the dialog.</p>

<ul>
<li>Curve Control Point Distance - How much the knot line follows its direction when 
                             exiting from an edge.</li>
<li>Crossing Gap - Distance between the end points when a lines are crossing.</li>
<li>Minimum Cusp Angle - Minimum angle between two edge to make the knot line 
                   display a cuspid rather than a smooth curve.</li>
<li>Curve Style  - Various cuspid shapes</li>
<li>Point Style  - How the sharp points are rendered
<ul>
<li>Bevel - Flat</li>
<li>Miter - with a sharp point</li>
<li>Round - Smooth</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>Some style settings can be configured on individual nodes, using the contect menu (right click on a node)</p>

<h2>Save and Load</h2>

<p>Knotter can save and load knots in its own human-readable format.</p>

<h3>Export</h3>

<p>The Export dialog gives many options to export the knot as Image</p>


<h4>Vector</h4>

<ul>
<li>Only shape - Only export the shape of the knot as a thin line, discarding 
            any other style option</li>
</ul>

<h4>Raster</h4>

<ul>
<li>Antialias   - If checked, the output image will be supersampled.</li>
<li>Compression - The compression level, the result depends on the exported format.
<ul>
<li>0%   = Large files</li>
<li>100% = Small files </li>
</ul></li>
<li>Width/Height - The resulting image size, if they are different from the 
             actual knot it will be scaled to fit those.</li>
<li>Keep Ratio   - When enabled, editing Width/Height will preserve their ratio.</li>
<li>Reset Size   - Change Width and Height back to the default.</li>
</ul>
