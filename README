Build instructions
---------------------------------------

Quick build

    ./configure.sh && make

The configuration script will generate the makefile using qmake and set up
the installation directories, for more information run

    ./configure.sh --help

If the configure script fails despite being in a proper build environment you
can run directly qmake  on knotter.pro. Be advised that this will make some
make targets buggy or unavailable.

By default knotter is configured to load resources from locations in the
filesystem, to generate a single stand-alone file containing all the data
pass the --single-file option to the configuration script

If you want to regenerate the files created by the Qt build tools, run

    make clean
    make

To install the binaries run

    make install

To install in a specific directory, you can set INSTALL_ROOT

    make install INSTALL_ROOT=/some/directory

The default install prefix is /usr/local (see ./configure.sh --help)
