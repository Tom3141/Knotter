Build instructions
---------------------------------------

This program uses the Qt framework, to generate the Makefile run

    qmake Knotter.pro

That will generate the Makefile and some additional source files,
at this point you can build the program using

    make


Other make targets
---------------------------------------

To make a tarball of the source run

    make mydist

The default make dist generated by qmake is very buggy, hence the mydist target.
Similarly to remove all generated files you can run

    make mydistclean

The source files are commented using Doxygen commands.
To generate the source documentation run

    make doc

( or just invoke doxygen if the Doxyfile is already present )
There's no target to clean output from Doxygen.
