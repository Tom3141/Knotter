Kotter
=======================================


Build instructions
---------------------------------------

This program uses the Qt framework, to generate the Makefile run

    qmake Knotter.pro

at this point you can build the program using

    make

If you want to regenerate the files created by the Qt build tools, run

    make clean
    make


To install the binaries run

    make INSTALL_ROOT=/your_path install

That will install the knotter executable as /your_path/bin/knotter
To uninstall it run

    make INSTALL_ROOT=/your_path uninstall


Other make targets
---------------------------------------

To make a tarball of the source run

    make mydist

The default make dist generated by qmake is very buggy, hence the mydist target.
Similarly to remove all generated files you can run

    make mydistclean

The source files are commented using Doxygen commands.
To generate the source documentation run

    make doc

There's no target to clean output from Doxygen.
