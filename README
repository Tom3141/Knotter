=======================================


Build instructions
---------------------------------------

Quick build

    ./configure.sh && make

The configuration script will generate the makefile using qmake and set up
the installation directories, for more information run

    ./configure.sh --help

If the configure script fails despite being in a proper build environment you
can run directly qmake  on knotter.pro. Be advised that this will make some
make targets buggy or unavailable.

If you want to regenerate the files created by the Qt build tools, run

    make clean
    make

To install the binaries run

    make install

The default install prefix is /usr/local

The source files are commented using Doxygen commands.
To generate the source documentation run

    make src_doc

There's no target to clean output from Doxygen.
